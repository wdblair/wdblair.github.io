<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this post, we introduce HotFuzz, a system that implements micro-fuzzing
for the purpose of detecting Algorithmic Complexity (AC) vulnerabilities in Java
programs and libraries. We give a high level overview of the system, introduce
some of the results we obtained from our evaluation, and provide more in-depth
case studies of our results than we were able to provide in our paper.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Fuzz Testing is a simple technique to detect bugs in programs and has
historically uncovered serious security vulnerabilities in widely used
software. Application developers normally compile their programs with special
instrumentation and pass them off to state of the art fuzzers, such as AFL or
libFuzzer, which automatically executes them indefinitely until the program
exhibits problematic behavior, such as writing past the boundary of a buffer,
and crashes the program. This offline testing is easy to perform, and the fact
that it is fully automated makes it an attractive way to detect bugs in
parallel with the software development lifecycle.<p>

<p>At the same time, state of the art fuzzers primarily focus on finding memory
corruption bugs that, if exploited,  could have serious security consequences.
For example, adversaries could take inputs that crash a given program and
extend them into exploits that hijack the program.  Second, fuzzers typically
only provide flat bitmaps as input to a program under test, and if users want
to fuzz individual methods in a program, they must manually define a test
harness that transforms this bitmap into the individual inputs needed for a
given method.</p>

<p>In this work, we propose micro-fuzzing as a technique that automatically
generates this test harness for arbitrary methods, and utilizes a genetic
algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java objects in order to maximize the resource
consumption for a specific method under test. We propose a sanitizer for
detecting AC vulnerabilities that is analagous to existing sanitizers that
cause a program to crash immediately when memory integrity violations occur,
such as when a program writes past the boundary of a buffer. This AC sanitizer
provides the signal to HotFuzz that an input triggers an AC vulnerability in a
method. In HotFuzz, we use the combination of micro-fuzzing to automatically
execute arbitrary Java methods, without the need to construct test harnesses,
and sanitize method executions to detect potential AC vulnerabilities in Java
libraries. The result of running HotFuzz on a given library are a corpus of
test cases that demonstrate potential AC vulnerabilities in a Java library
which adversaries could utilize to achieve Denial of Service in victim
programs. Our goal in performing this offline testing is to discover these bugs
so that developers can patch them before adversaries have the chance to exploit
them.</p>

<h2>System Description</h2>

<p>
The following diagram shows how HotFuzz works end to end on a given Java
library.  First, every method contained in the library is submitted to a
distributed set of microFuzz instances running on a Kubernetes Cluster.
Upon receiving a method under test, microFuzz examines the type signature
of the method and automatically attempts to create valid instances of the
types needed to invoke the method. These instances form the seed inputs for
micro-fuzzing, and in the paper we propose a novel seed selection strategy
called Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) and evaluate its performance, measured
by the number of AC bugs it detects, to the simplest possible strategy, called
(IVI). The details of both approaches can be found in the
<a href="/papers/hotfuzz.pdf">paper</a>.</p>

<p>After a set of seed inputs are generated, HotFuzz uses a genetic algorithm
to search for  inputs that maximize the resource consumption for a given
method. A genetic algorithm evolves a population of inputs in a process that
mimics natural selection. Over a period of generations the most fit inputs
carry produce offspring, and less fit inputs die off. In HotFuzz, the fitness
of a given individual is measured by the execution time of the method when invoked
on the input. Fuzzers typically produce new offspring by applying standard
crossover and mutation operators to flat bitmaps, which do not readily apply
to instances of arbitrary Java types. For this reason, we propose new techniques
for crossing over and mutating arbitrary Java objects in order to produce new
offspring in HotFuzz's genetic algorithm. The combination of generating test
harnesses automatically, and evolving instances of complex types is the core
of micro-fuzzing outlined in the <a href="/papers/hotfuzz.html">paper</a>.</p>

<p>After micro-fuzzing completes for a given library, we save all the results
into a database for the witness validation stage of HotFuzz. During micro-fuzzing,
HotFuzz may observe a test case triggers an AC vulnerability in a method, but
this may be the result of a benign method polling on a socket or a file, or
simply sleeping. To eliminate these false positives from our results, we synthesize
test cases into Java programs, and monitor their execution outside the fuzzing framework
in a production Java environment with JIT enabled.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The primary goal of our evaluation was to understand whether micro-fuzzing
is effective at detecting AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries, and to measure
the efficiency of SRI as a seed selection strategy. To do so, we evaluated HotFuzz
over the entire Java Runtime Environment (JRE), all challenges contained in the
DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program, and the top
100 most popular libraries contained in Maven. Micro-fuzzing production code
helps us understand whether the technique can detect real bugs, but to measure
SRIs effectiveness we propose Initial Value Instantiation (IVI) as a baseline
that starts micro-fuzzing with empty inputs.</p>

<p>In the following graphs, you can see the performance of each seed selection
strategy over time. Each plot shows the cumulative number of AC bugs detected
as HotFuzz micro-fuzzes all the methods contained in a given library. Observe
that for every artifact we consider, SRI outperforms the baseline strategy
IVI.</p>

<h2>Slow Arithmetic in the Java Runtime Environment</h2>

<p>Consider the following Java program.</p>
<pre>
    import java.math.BigDecimal;

    class BigDecimalPoC {
      public static void main(String args[]) {
        BigDecimal x = new BigDecimal("1e2147483647");
        BigDecimal y = x.add(new BigDecimal(1));
      }
    }
</pre>

<p>Over the course of our evaluation we found that this simple program was able
to dramatically slow down the <span class="code">BigDecimal.add</span> method across three
different implementations of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). We present the root
cause of this issue in our paper, but intuitively the issue lies in an
intermediate variable created by <span class="code">BigDecimal.add</span> that it uses to sum
two numbers in scientific notation with different exponents. In this example,
we force this intermediate value to be as large as possible, and force
<span class="code">BigDecimal.add</span> to compute the value "1e2147483647" directly as a
<span class="code">BigInteger</span>, Java's class for arbitrary precision integers.  We
observed that this can take anywhere to an hour on the OpenJDK to over four
months on IBM's J9 JVM. In this section, we detail the behavior we observed in
each implementation of the JVM including the OpenJDK, IBM J9, and Android
ART.</p>

<h3>OpenJDK</h3>

<p>
Running the PoC on OpenJDK 8 ends in an exception, but 53 minutes after the
start of the execution. As described in the paper, recent builds of the OpenJDK
immediately throw the exception, which still allows an adversary to affect the
availibility of a victim program, but to a lesser extant then we previously
observed.</p>

<h3>IBM J9</h3>

<p>IBM&#39;s implementation of the JVM appears the most vulnerable to this issue, as
our proof of concept program ran for over 4 months before the OS killed the
process. After disclosing the vulnerability, IBM issued a <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1517">CVE</a> for the bug.</p>

<h3>Android ART 8.0</h3>

<p>
We embedded our PoC into an Android App in order to evaluate the extent
to which Android's implementation of <span class="code">BigDecimal.add</span> is vulnerable to
the performance issue we observed in other JVMs. In this app, a button triggers
the execution of the PoC and we observed the task crash after running for 13
minutes. This experiment was performed on an x86 Android emulator running
Android ART 8.0.</p>

<p>The underlying error thrown by Android's runtime appears similar to the error message thrown by OpenJDK, but it's interesting to see the exception come from the <span class="code">OPENSSL</span> module. Furthermore, we observed the runtime of the PoC vary in strange ways in the Android environment as we varied the value of the exponent given in the PoC. We would expect the runtime of the app to scale linearly as the value of the exponent used in the PoC scales grows. As the following graph shows, the runtime appears to peak, and then drop off after a certain point. Intuitively, this could represent the cut off for when the value of the <span class="code">BigInteger</span> exceeds a threshold, and the library responds by terminating the computation with an exception. As we note in our paper, Google did not consider this a security issue for the Android platform.</p>

<h2>Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>HotFuzz was developed over the course of the DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. In our paper, we evaluated Hotfuzz over all the STAC challenges using a single configuration, but over the course of the program we frequently micro-fuzzed individual methods contained in the challenges. One feature not discussed in our paper is HotFuzz&#39;s ability to micro-fuzz a method for AC vulnerabilities with respect to space with memory measurements provided by the EyeVM. In the following graph, you can see how HotFuzz demonstrates the presence of an AC vulnerability in space by causing the method under test to consume memory until it exceeds the time threshold and HotFuzz kills the process. The test case in the upper right hand corner in the graph demonstrates the presence of an AC vulnerability in space.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
In this work, we propose micro-fuzzing as a technique for automatically
constructing test harnesses around arbitrary methods and sanitizing their
execution for AC vulnerabilities. We proposed new seed selection strategies and
evaluated their performance, measured by the number of bugs they detected, over
production software and on challenges constained in the STAC program. We
observed that micro-fuzzing detects real bugs in practice, and that our
proposed seed selection strategy (SRI) outperformed the baseline strategy
(IVI). We presented several case studies and disclosed our findings to
vendors, who confirmed our results. The complete description of our system and
results can be found in our <a href="/papers/hotfuzz.pdf">paper</a> <a href="/papers/hotfuzz.bib">[bib]</a>.
